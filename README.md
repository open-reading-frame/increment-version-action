# increment-version-action

This action will create a new tag based on a version in a JSON file in source control, and on pushes to specified branches will push the newly created tag.
This is intended to help automate semantic versioning (https://semver.org/) tags for repositories for each PR merge to main (or another default branch).
Version tags will be generated in the format `major.minor.patch-release`.
If the version is not changed for a given PR, the `release` number will be incremented by 1, intended to reflect changes to things like process, build, docs, tests, etc. that do not impact actual code.
The new version will be set as an output of the action called `outputs.new-version`.
This value can be used in subsequent steps/jobs where a version identifier is needed.

## Tag Protection

To prevent pushed tags from being deleted, [tag protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-tag-protection-rules) may be put in place.
These rules also prevent tags from being pushed within admin-level repository write permissions.
To push tags matching given tag protection rules, a personal access token with Contents write permissions belonging to an organization admin user must be provided.

To protect *all* tags generated by this action, the tag protection rule `*.*.*-*` can be used.

## Example

```yaml
# This template is intended to be incorporated as a workflow in another repository to semi-automatically increment
# an internal/external version number for a repository
name: tag-pr-merge

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]  # Or the name of your default branch
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  increment-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      new-version: ${{ steps.run-increment-version.outputs.new-version }}
    steps:
      - name: Run the increment-version action
        id: run-increment-version
        uses: open-reading-frame/increment-version-action@main
        with:
          json: <path/to/repo-data.json>
          token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}, if not provided will default to github.token
```
